# Annual-Base-Salary-Percentile-Estimation
A machine learning model is created on a subset of OWES dataset (Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics) 
The Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) program produces employment and wage estimates annually for nearly 800 occupations. These estimates are available for the nation as a whole, for individual states, and for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas; national occupational estimates for specific industries are also available.
The data used in this problem is a subset of the OEWS data, which include the 10-th percentile, 25-th percentile, 50-th percentile (a.k.a median), 75-th percentile, and 90-th percentile of the annual salary of a given combination of states, industries, and occupations.
